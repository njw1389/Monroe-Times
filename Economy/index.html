      <h2>Introduction</h2>

            The COVID-19 pandemic sent shock waves through the world economy. It triggered the most significant 
            global economic crisis in more than a century. Moreover, the crisis led to a dramatic increase in 
            inequality within and across countries. Evidence suggests that the recovery from the crisis will be 
            as uneven as its initial economic impacts, with emerging economies and economically disadvantaged groups 
            needing much more time to recover from pandemic-induced losses of income and livelihoods.

      <h2>The Impact On The Stock Market</h2>
      <div class="market">

         <p>
            Covid significantly impacted the stock market in all sectors of the economy. With everything shut down, 
            the supply chain slowed and even stopped; with the supply chain stopped, businesses weren't able to do 
            business which caused the market to drop even more. Finally, the market got so low they talked about 
            shutting it down. So obviously, this had a significant impact on society. It affected families, school 
            districts, businesses, the government, and many more.

      <h2>The Government Response</h2>

         <p>
            The government responses to the pandemic were extraordinarily swift and encompassing. Governments embraced 
            many policy tools that were either entirely unprecedented or had never been used on this scale in emerging 
            economies. While necessary and effective in mitigating the worst impacts of the crisis, the significant crisis 
            response led to a global increase in government debt that gave rise to renewed concerns about debt sustainability 
            and added to the widening disparity between emerging and advanced economies.
         </p>

      <h2>The Impact On Citizens Savings</h2>
      <div class="savings">
         <img src="../assets/images/savings.jpeg" alt="">
         <p>
            With The Stock market down, citizens investing portfolios took a hit which took years of investing and waiting; 
            citizens were back to square one in most sectors of the economy. Unfortunately, it will be a while before the 
            stock market returns to what it was because of all the new variants and now the war in Ukraine, which also
             severely impacted the market.
