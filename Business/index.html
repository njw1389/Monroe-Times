      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div class='business'>
         <img src="../assets/images/market.jpeg" alt="">
         <p>
            The coronavirus pandemic affected all sectors of the economy in 2020, from movie theaters and 
            nail salons to warehouses and meat processing facilities. As a result, many businesses across 
            the country saw their supply chains interrupted, demand for their products and services decline, 
            shortages in supplies and inputs, and government-mandated closures. At the same time, the federal 
            government implemented programs designed to help keep employees on payrolls. These are just some 
            of the effects of the pandemic on businesses and their employees.
         </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Closures</h2>
      <div class="closures">
         <img src="../assets/images/closure.jpeg" alt="">
         <p>
            The pandemic had already caused massive dislocation among small businesses just several weeks after 
            its onset and before the availability of government aid through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
            Economic Security (CARES) Act. Across the sample of 5,800 small businesses, 43% of companies had 
            temporarily closed, and nearly all of these closures were due to COVID-19. ​​The Family Had to close 
            the gyms they've had for decades because they were forced to close by the government to keep everyone 
            safe. So many businesses had to sell or go bankrupt since no one was trying to start a new business then.
         </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Not Enough Customers</h2>
      <div class="customers">
         <img src="../assets/images/customers.jpeg" alt="">
         <p>
            Businesses also needed more customers. The pandemic caused the government to issue lockdowns, so people 
            didn't go out to be safe, and companies weren't getting enough customers to pay the bills, which forced 
            them to sell their businesses. Many local companies that have been around for decades with a rich history 
            went under because either customers weren't coming or the government forced them to close, for example, gyms. 
         </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Lack of Employees</h2>
      <div class="employees">

         <p>
            On average, the businesses reported having reduced their active employment by 39% since January. The decline 
            was particularly sharp in the Mid-Atlantic region (which includes New York City), where 54% of firms were 
            closed, and employment was down by 47%. Over the entire sample, the number of full-time employees fell by 
            32% between January 31 and late March 2020. In addition, the number of part-time employees was 57% lower 
            than at the end of January. As a result, overall employment declined significantly, totaling a 39% reduction 
            from the January headcount.
