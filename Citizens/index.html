            The coronavirus pandemic has had unprecedented, widespread impacts on households across America, 
            raising concerns about our ability to weather long-term health and financial harms. A substantial 
            share of households has not been protected from the severe impacts of the pandemic across many areas 
            of residents' lives. At least half of households in the four largest U.S. cities—New York City (53%), 
            Los Angeles (56%), Chicago (50%), and Houston (63%)—report severe financial problems, including depleted 
            savings, and trouble paying bills or affording medical care And not limited to just financial issues.

         <p>
            With businesses in the red, they were forced to let go of staff 43 percent of rural households report 
            adult household members lost their jobs, been furloughed, or had wages or hours reduced since the start 
            of the outbreak, with two-thirds of these households (66%) reporting severe financial problems. This 
            severely impacts families across the globe and causes them to worry about not being able to provide for 
            their families. But with all the new jobs the government created and businesses doing better, adults are
            getting their jobs back every day.

      <h2>Lost Family</h2>

         <p>
            Covid killed over 6 million people worldwide, which is crazy. So many families lost members. Nearly 8 
            million kids lost a parent or primary caregiver to the pandemic. This severely impacted many people 
            worldwide, and many worried about catching covid doing anything out of their houses. So many people 
            were very strict about quarantining, which severely affected their mental health.

      <h2>Events Closed</h2>
      <div class="events">
         <img src="../assets/images/Empty_Stadium.jpeg" alt="">
         <p>
            With everyone in quarantine and government lockdowns, events got canceled. Professional sports got canceled 
            and delayed, and family traditions ended, concerts canceled, and so much more. This affected people since 
            people's personalities included these events. People used the event as an outlet for stress and to just had 
            a good time, and with these canceled, people just sat at home bored and depressed. Billions of dollars were 
            lost due to these events being canceled, which would have ended up being spent improving the economy.

      <h2>The Mask Mandates</h2>

         <img src="../assets/images/Mask_Mandates.jpeg" alt="">
         <p>
            Mask mandates affected the community. People with health conditions were exempt, but what about the other 
            citizens? Autistic citizens experience sensory differently, so something like a mask affects their mental 
            health. Claustrophobic citizens sometimes have a mini panic attack from the mask. Many citizens hated masks 
            but were forced to wear them in public. People were arrested, and students were denied access to school for n
            ot wearing masks.
